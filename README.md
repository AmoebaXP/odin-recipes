# odin-recipes
This is the first major project I've done since starting The Odin Project. It's a simple skeleton of a HTML recipe link website, which is plain but functional. I may return to this project in the future to update some code with CSS and Javascript just to flesh it out a bit more for fun, but for now I plan on continuing with The Odin Project curriculum.
